The project aims to develop a cutting-edge 3-D Earth Dynamic Display
using a robust stack of technologies including OSGEarth, OSG, VC++,OpenGL
VCPKG Manager, Visual Studio, Cmake. OSGEarth and OSG
(OpenSceneGraph) will form the backbone for rendering and visualising
dynamic Earth data in three dimensions, leveraging their powerful capabilities
in geospatial visualisation and simulation. VC++ will be utilised for its
efficiency and versatility in implementing core functionalities, integrated with
tools like VCPKG Manager for seamless library management. Visual Studio
will provide a comprehensive development environment, ensuring robust
software engineering practices. Cmake helps us to build binary files of the
libraries. Together, these technologies will enable the creation of an innovative
and interactive platform for exploring and analysing dynamic Earth phenomena
